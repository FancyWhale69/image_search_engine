# Image Search Engine  

# About:  
An attemp to build an image search engine using TensorflowAPi.  

# install:  
Please follow this guide to install TensorflowAPI:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDm_YOwP2zY.  
After installin tensorflowAPI place the notebook in "models/research/object_detection".  


# Program Features:  
1- Can search for multiple objects.  
2- Can show boxes around the specified objects.  
3- Can set how many images you want to retrive.  
4- Shuffle images before search.  
5- show the path of the image.  
6- images are ranked based on how relevent they are to the query.  
  
# Tools:  
python, tensorflow.  
  
# Notebooks:  
result analyziz: comparing the performance of the models.  
Results_model_faster_rcnn: uses faster rcnn for object detection.  
Results_model_mask_rcnn: uses mask rcnn for object detection.  
Results_model_ssd_mobilenet: uses ssd mobilenet for object detection.  
Results_model_ssd_resnet50_v1: uses ssd resnet50 v1 for object detection.
